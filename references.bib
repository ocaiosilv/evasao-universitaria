                  computing library for the Python programming
                  language. Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy
                  has become a de facto standard for leveraging
                  scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600
                  unique code contributors, thousands of dependent
                  packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and
                  millions of downloads per year. In this work, we
                  provide an overview of the capabilities and
                  development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight
                  some recent technical developments.},

  abstract =     {Financial stress—the psychological and physical
                  strain from financial instability—is increasingly
                  prevalent today. This analysis explores how
                  financial stress impacts health and success, using a
                  mixed-methods approach to examine effects on immune
                  function, metabolic health, sleep, mental health,
                  cognitive ability, behavior, and relationships. It
                  also evaluates success metrics like career growth,
                  academic performance, entrepreneurship, and personal
                  development. The study applies the Biopsychosocial
                  Model of Health and the Transactional Model of
                  Stress and Coping to understand these complex
                  interactions. While prior research highlights the
                  widespread impact of financial stress, gaps remain
                  regarding its long-term effects and variations
                  across groups. Findings show financial stress
                  increases risks of high blood pressure, heart
                  disease, immune suppression, metabolic disorders,
                  anxiety, depression, substance abuse, social
                  isolation, and diminished life performance. The
                  study emphasizes the need for holistic solutions by
                  uncovering feedback loops between stress and success
                  outcomes. Proposed solutions include financial
                  advising, policy reforms, and personal strategies
                  like financial literacy and stress management. It
                  calls for further research into innovative
                  interventions, especially through digital tools and
                  social support networks.},
